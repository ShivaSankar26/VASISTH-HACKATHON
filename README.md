# problem statement 
In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving digital landscape, cyber threats have grown more advanced, making it increasingly challenging for individuals and organizations to safeguard their sensitive data. Phishing attacks, malicious URLs, and deceptive websites pose significant risks, leading to financial losses and security breaches. Traditional cybersecurity awareness programs lack real-time threat detection and fail to offer proactive defense mechanisms, leaving users vulnerable to evolving cyber risks.
# proposed solution
the Cybersecurity Threat Simulator is an innovative, AI-driven security solution designed to provide real-time phishing detection and protection through an integrated Secure Browsing App and Chrome Extension. This solution enhances user security by leveraging machine learning algorithms and advanced threat analysis. Key functionalities include:
Automated scanning and detection of malicious websites, preventing access to harmful pages.
Instant real-time alerts that notify users when they encounter potential phishing threats.
Phishing URL identification, where deceptive links are clearly marked in red to increase user awareness.
Browsing history tracking, categorizing visited sites as safe or phishing, ensuring transparency in online activity.
Whitelisting functionality, allowing users to mark specific URLs as safe for uninterrupted browsing
The Chrome Extension further strengthens security by:
Scanning entire web pages and dynamically analyzing potential phishing threats.
Classifying URLs and highlighting phishing links in real time.
Implementing a user-adaptive whitelist/blacklist system to customize security settings based on personal preferences.
